- The objective of Exercise 6.2 is to create a service that, when called, will make BB8 robot move in a circle-like trajectory.

- You can work on a new package or use the one you created for Exercise 5.1, called **unit_5_services**.

- Create a Service Server that accepts an **Empty** service message and activates the circle movement. This service could be called **/move_bb8_in_circle**.

  You will place the necessary code into a new Python file named **bb8_move_in_circle_service_server.py**. You can use the Python file [simple_service_server.py](https://i-07520ae50c0c30361.robotigniteacademy.com/7cbfedc2-6967-49c8-b76a-8c94d962a88b/jupyter/notebooks/basic_ROS/unit3_basicROS_Part2_v2.ipynb#prg-3-7) as an example.

- Create a launch file called **start_bb8_move_in_circle_service_server.launch**. Inside it, you have to start a node that launches the **bb8_move_in_circle_service_server.py** file.

- Launch **start_bb8_move_in_circle_service_server.launch** and check that, when called through the WebShell, BB-8 moves in a circle.

- Now, create a new Python file called **bb8_move_in_circle_service_client.py** that calls the service **/move_bb8_in_circle**. Remember how it was done in the previous chapter: **Services Part 1**.

  Then, generate a new launch file called **call_bb8_move_in_circle_service_server.launch** that executes the code in the **bb8_move_in_circle_service_client.py** file.

- Finally, when you launch this **call_bb8_move_in_circle_service_server.launch** file, BB-8 should move in a circle.
